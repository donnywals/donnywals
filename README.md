# Hi There!

My name is Donny, and I'm an iOS engineer, blogger, and author. I love learning, sharing what I know, and playing the guitar 🎸.

* 📗 If you want to learn more about Apple's Combine framework, I recommend you read my book [Practical Combine](https://practicalcombine.com).
* 🎁 I built a website that helps you understand [SwiftUI's property wrappers](https://swiftuipropertywrappers.com).
* 🐦 Follow my [Twitter account](https://twitter.com/donnywals) where I make semi-regular attempts at tweeting cool stuff.
